Greetings, I'm the Tech Guru Dwight Spencer(aka Master Den Zuko). I publish a blog known as The Teachings of Master Den Zuko while heading up developments and operations at CompuTEK Industries. I have been working with computers and website design for over twelve years now starting with the Software Systems Online BBS back in the late 1996 and moving on to join the gang at hDc to learn programming, site design, IT, and system security.

The Teachings of Master Den Zuko is for those who just can't stop tinkering, re-creating, and inventing cool new technology that impacts our lives. We are dedicated to the incorrigible and chronically incurable technology enthusiast in all of us and strive to preserve your right to tweak, hack, and bend technology to your whim.
