It begins today, after a trip to my local wal-mart and a quick shopping spree I finally have the basics to start my art works.
I've been wanting to do this style of art since I was ten, so I'm really looking forward to all this.

Up untill now I've only had a few standard notebooks, pens, a sharpie marker or two and a vision. But, isn't that how everything starts?
A goal and dream with a few basic suppilies
